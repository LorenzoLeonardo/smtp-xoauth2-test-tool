# smtp-xoauth2-test-tool

This is a test tool for the SMTP XOAUTH2 email workflow.  
It uses OpenID Connect to obtain the name and email of the  
authenticated user via OAuth2 and then sends a test SMTP email  
to a specified recipient.

The motivation for this project is to verify whether any  
breakages occur at the endpoints. Sometimes, providers make  
changes that introduce issues without notice. Itâ€™s better to  
detect these problems in advance rather than waiting for  
clients to call and complain.

Notes:

### The \<provider\> can be of the following:
- Microsoft
- Google

- None (If there is no client secret)
- Client Secret string (If there is a client secret)

### The \<access token grant type\> can be of the following:

- DeviceCodeFlow

### The \<debug log level\> can be of the following
